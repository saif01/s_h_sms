```bash
# Create migration
php artisan make:migration create_feature_table

# Edit migration file in database/migrations/
# Define table structure

# Run migration
php artisan migrate
```

#### Step 2: Create Model

```bash
php artisan make:model Feature
```

Edit `app/Models/Feature.php`:
- Define `$fillable` fields
- Add relationships
- Add scopes if needed

#### Step 3: Create Controller

```bash
php artisan make:controller Api/FeatureController
```

Location: `app/Http/Controllers/Api/FeatureController.php`

Implement:

- `destroy()` - Delete

#### Step 4: Add Routes

Edit `routes/api.php`:

```php
Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'admin'])->group(function () {
    Route::apiResource('features', FeatureController::class)
        ->middleware('permission:manage-features');
});
```

#### Step 5: Create Frontend Component

1. Create component: `resources/js/components/admin/feature/AdminFeatures.vue`
2. Follow existing component patterns:
   - Use `commonMixin` for common functionality
   - Use `paginationMixin` for pagination
   - Create dialog components for add/edit/view

#### Step 6: Add Route to Frontend

Edit `resources/js/routes.js`:

```javascript
{
    path: 'features',
    component: () => import('./components/admin/feature/AdminFeatures.vue'),
    name: 'AdminFeatures',
    meta: { title: 'Feature Management', permissions: ['manage-features'] }
}
```

#### Step 7: Add to Navigation Menu

# Format PHP code with Laravel Pint
./vendor/bin/pint

# Or
php artisan pint
```

### 6.4 Git Workflow
